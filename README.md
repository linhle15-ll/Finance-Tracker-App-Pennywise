## Project Description

### What Tech Stacks are used? 

For this project, I use <strong>MERN Stack</strong>, which is a common tech stack for app development:

- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/mongodb.png" width="20"/> <strong> MongoDB</strong> for database 
- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/48/000000/node-js.png" width="20"/> <strong> Express.js (Node.js)</strong> for Backend 
- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/000000/react.png" width="20"/> <strong> React.js - Next.js </strong> for Frontend
- üêª <strong>Zustand</strong> (instead of Redux) </strong> for Statement management

### Where I got the inspiration form (Why the app is created? )
An inspiration for me to work on a project often stems from my own problem, and my perspective on the problem with other people. Personally speaking, I am not very good at financial management, but I tried to be better at this when I started my independent life as an international student in a completely foreign country and started my first job. I deeply understand how important it is for students like me to feel "safe and secure" about financial matters.

Thus, <strong> PennyWise </strong> is a solution that helps users to:
- <strong> smartly manage their money </strong>, or income and expense in particular
- <strong> keep up reasonable financial management habit</strong>: for what and how much money should be used 
- <strong> feel motivated</strong>: a <em> special algorithm </em> that aligns with user's intention to budget for future goals 

I hope that this app can do better than this with more promising improvements in the future. Possible technical implementations that are being considered are <strong> more attracting UI </strong>, <strong> minigames </strong> to improve interaction with users, and on top of all, <strong>AI/ML applications</strong> to predict user's habits and provide smart finanical suggestions. My expectations to better my prooduct motivates me to learn a lot everyday!

## Special Feature: An Algorithm! 
While making this app, I am thinking of my case. Sometimes, I wonder how much money I am having now for certain goals/ expenditure sections, such as a NYC trip this winter, or budgets to buy a Colombia Coat. Therefore, I <strong> create an algorithm </strong> for this app that works in a way that:

- Keep track of the balance </strong>, where current balance = current total income - current total expense
- Allowing users to actively set <strong> how much % of balance would be distributed for the target budget </strong>.
</br>For example, I would set 40% of balance for monthly book subscription and 20% for money saving up for NYC trip 
-  Therefore, users can clearly know how much money they are having for a certain target budget, and thus <strong> better determining when to spend the money </strong> without much worry about distributions for other targets (better financial plannings)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
# repo: https://github.com/linhle15-ll/finance-tracker-app-pennywise.git
```
- You can Split the terminal and run the BACKEND and FRONTEND separatedly by:
```bash
cd BACKEND
npm run dev
```
```bash
cd FRONTEND
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `FRONTEND/...` for FRONTEND and `BACKEND/...` for BACKEND. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Poppins, a custom Google Font.
